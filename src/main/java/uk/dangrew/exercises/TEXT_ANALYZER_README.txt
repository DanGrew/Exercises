REQUIREMENTS & DESIGN
The exercise simply requires a 'display' of the analysis. Simple solution - System.out. However, that would
never be used in production, so it would be one thing that definitely needed an alternative. I've opted for 
a simple interface here, very little effort and decouples the solution from the method of results output. 


TESTING
Some objects are simple. I could test them. It's a question of value for the time it takes, 
and focus on the important aspects of the code. I've omitted some tests based on this.
